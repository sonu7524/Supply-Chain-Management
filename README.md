 Snakes and ladders is a board game for two or more players. A number of "ladders" and "snakes" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares.
 The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), 
 helped by climbing ladders but hindered by falling down snakes. The game is a simple race based on sheer luck.
 Play it well.
